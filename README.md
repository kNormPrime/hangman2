# hangman2

## description
This project is a simple console interface version of the game hangman, in which the user attempts to guess an unknown word one letter at a time by submitting input of letter guesses when prompted to do so.  For each unknown word, designated as a round in the game, the user loses the round after 6 incorrect letter guesses, and wins if all letters are guessed correctly before reaching the incorrect guess count limit.


### how to interact with the console
To begin the game, the user types "node ." into the console and hits the "enter" button.  When prompted, the user types in an alphabetic keyboard character as a letter guess and hits the "enter" button.  To stop playing, the user hits "control+c" buttons.
